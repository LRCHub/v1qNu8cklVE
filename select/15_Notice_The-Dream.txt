Shit, this shit, this shit
This my shit, my shit, my shit
This my shit, my shit, my shit
This my, this my, this my, this my, this my
This my shit, boy, this my shit
This my shit, girl, this my shit
Ah, this my shit, girl, this my shit

It's 5:30 in the morning, I can't sleep
It's like everytime you leave, you take another part of me
Yeah, yeah, huh
5:31 in the morning, I pray you're dreaming about me
I wish you would've just stayed with me
Baby, just lay with me
I been tryna get you to focus, I'm all about you
I've hoped that you've noticed
Quit bringing up your past and your last, girl, focus
I know you think it's hopeless
Said your ex be in and out of your life

If you want, we can put that nigga on notice
He ain't even gotta come and get his shit
Come over here, leave his shit where it is
Put that nigga on notice
Bring your mind and body to my destination
Break your lease, don't worry about a early termination
Put that nigga on notice

Put that nigga on notice

Oh, baby
