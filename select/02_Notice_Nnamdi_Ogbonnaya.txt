I'm trying to do more right
Yeah, I'm trying to be nice
(It's not as easy)
As I would have liked
But I'm trying to be polite

I'm trying to do more right
Yeah, I'm trying to be nice
(It's not as easy)
As I would have liked
But I'm trying to be polite

They be chillin' in the trunk with a sawed off
Niggas get popped off yo
How the fuck have you niggas ain't notice yet
Cops not really tryin' to help us nah
How the fuck do you nigga's ain't notice yet

(Tryin' to be, I'm tryin' to be, I'm tryin' to be more cautious)
(Tryin' to be, I'm tryin' to be, I'm tryin' to be more cautious)

Walk too hot like you own that block
How the fuck do nigga's think you know whats wack
Talk that shit, I'mma drop that bitch
How the fuck do you nigga's ain't know me yet

(Tryin' to be, I'm tryin' to be, I'm tryin' to be more honest)
(Tryin' to be, I'm tryin' to be, I'm tryin' to be more honest)

And all the yuppies think they can stop me nah
How the fuck have you niggas ain't cloned me yet
Not me, no you never saw me
Talking to the drone have a coffee with a police vest

You give a cop an inch, he'll take a fucking mile
You give a badge a gun, they'll kill your fucking child
Homie gotta die 'cause he stole a Black & Mild
And his life only probably cost half that much

Young nigga better not ash that bun
Keep the candle burning, fucking pass it
Show me the papers that got you that paid leave (uh huh)
Show me the van that proves you kill kids

Paint it what you want it
But you saying to be honest
I can find you when that nigga finally open up
I got plenty mother fuckers that got lots of little brothers
Don't complain about a motherfucking Starbucks cup

I'm trying to do more right
Yeah, I'm trying to be nice
(It's not as easy)
As I would have liked
But I'm trying to be polite
