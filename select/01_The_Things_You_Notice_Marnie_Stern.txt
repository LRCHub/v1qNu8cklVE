I got. I need. I got a really special one.
I got. I need. I got a really special one.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not gonna let him go.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not gonna let him go.

You're that one.
Our love settles down. Into soft sweet sounds.
You're that one.
I lost and you found. I lost and you found,
I was lost and you found me.

You understand. You in my thoughts.
You in my heart. You are my plan.
You win my heart. You understand.
You in my thoughts. You win my thoughts.
