To the beast of falling rain
Playing on the roof again
Ideas float through, it's just a game
Over being slow and down
We could cruise around the town
Smile, it's raining here right now

And anyway what good is hanging to your hems?
And anyway is yours as long as you'll pretend
Not to be withheld or turn away
Over pages under thoughts and here today

We could move the window pane
Sick of being all the same
It's so dreary anyway
And if the dark comes back at night
Another time, another fight
Just know tomorrow we'll be alright

And anyway what good is hanging to your hems?
And anyway is yours as long as you'll pretend
Not to be withheld or turn away
Over pages under thoughts and here today
